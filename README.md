# TEAM1
We are Team 1 and it Week 4

We are diving into the Global Burden of Disease data from 1999-2019 to seek to better understand alcohol and substance use disorders on a global scale. Our dataset includes observations from most of the world countries for all 21 years, with measurements for the rate (per 100k people) of substance use disorder incidences (based on the DM5) and deaths.

# Potential Research Avenues
+ Is there a correlation between a country's economic status and it's rate of substance use disorders?
+ Which substance(s) is(are) the biggest problem? Not just in incidences or deaths but also in effects.
+ What is the relationship between incidences and deaths?
+ Does the presence of any substance use disorder increase the likelihood of another? Are any especially interrelated? 

HELLO WORLD
