## Do ANOVA between groups for Drinking Age and Religion to see which subgroups
## you can combine. Then, do it again with new groups (in a sensible way). Next,
## after one-hot coding them as binary for multiple regression, select the reference
## category from each variable to be the one that stands apart from the others.
## Consider doing this for civil liberties and regime as well. 
## Also, center consumption variables (subtract of means).
## Finally, check model for normality conditions.
